# Gomoku

Classic Gomoku (5 in a row) with bots.

How to play: Each players take turn to place their stone on a 19 x 19 board, Black goes first, who ever make the first 5 in a row wins. Similar to TicTacToe or Caro. Stones once placed cannot be removed. No additional limitation.

If you wish to review the bot's log, execute ***"dev_run.bat"***, or open cmd and type ***"java -jar Gomoku.jar"*** (only for Windows and you should place ***"/Gomoku"*** in a different directory other than ***"/Downloads"***), if not then you can just execute ***"Gomoku.jar"***, or run ***"run.vbs"***. Thanks for trying out my program!

Compiled in Java 15
